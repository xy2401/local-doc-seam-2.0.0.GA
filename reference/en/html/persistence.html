        Seam provides extensive support for the two most popular persistence
        architectures for Java: Hibernate3, and the Java Persistence API
        introduced with EJB 3.0. Seam's unique state-management architecture
        allows the most sophisticated ORM integration of any web application 
        framework.
    </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e5620"></a>8.1.&nbsp;Introduction</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        Seam grew out of the frustration of the Hibernate team with the 
        statelessness typical of the previous generation of Java application 
        architectures. The state management architecture of Seam was originally
        designed to solve problems relating to persistence&#8212;in particular
        problems associated with <span class="emphasis"><em>optimistic transaction processing</em></span>.
        Scalable online applications always use optimistic transactions. An atomic 
        (database/JTA) level transaction should not span a user interaction unless
        the application is designed to support only a very small number of concurrent
        clients. But almost all interesting work involves first displaying data
        to a user, and then, slightly later, updating the same data. So Hibernate was
        designed to support the idea of a persistence context which spanned an
        optimistic transaction. 
    </p><p>
        Unfortunately, the so-called "stateless" architectures that preceded Seam and 
        EJB 3.0 had no construct for representing an optimistic transaction. So, instead,
        these architectures provided persistence contexts scoped to the atomic
        transaction. Of course, this resulted in many problems for users, and is the
        cause of the number one user complaint about Hibernate: the dreaded 
        <tt class="literal">LazyInitializationException</tt>. What we need is a construct
        for representing an optimistic transaction in the application tier.
    </p><p>
        EJB 3.0 recognizes this problem, and introduces the idea of a stateful
        component (a stateful session bean) with an <span class="emphasis"><em>extended persistence 
        context</em></span> scoped to the lifetime of the component. This is a
        partial solution to the problem (and is a useful construct in and of 
        itself) however there are two problems:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                The lifecycle of the stateful session bean must be managed manually
                via code in the web tier (it turns out that this is a subtle problem
                and much more difficult in practice than it sounds).
            </p></li><li><p>
                Propagation of the persistence context between stateful components
                in the same optimistic transaction is possible, but tricky.
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Seam solves the first problem by providing conversations, and stateful
        session bean components scoped to the conversation. (Most conversations 
        actually represent optimistic transactions in the data layer.) This is
        sufficient for many simple applications (such as the Seam booking
        demo) where persistence context propagation is not needed. For more
        complex applications, with many loosly-interacting components in each
        conversation, propagation of the persistence context across components
        becomes an important issue. So Seam extends the persistence context
        management model of EJB 3.0, to provide conversation-scoped extended
        persistence contexts.
    </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="persistence.seam-managed-transactions"></a>8.2.&nbsp;Seam managed transactions</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            EJB session beans feature declarative transaction management. The EJB container is able
            to start a transaction transparently when the bean is invoked, and end it when the
            invocation ends. If we write a session bean method that acts as a JSF action listener, 
            we can do all the work associated with that action in one transaction, and be sure that
            it is committed or rolled back when we finish processing the action. This is a great feature, 
            and all that is needed by some Seam applications.
    	</p><p>
            However, there is a problem with this approach. A Seam application may not perform all data
            access for a request from a single method call to a session bean.
    	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                    The request might require processing by several loosly-coupled components, each
                    of which is called independently from the web layer. It is common to see several
                    or even many calls per request from the web layer to EJB components in Seam.
    			</p></li><li><p>
                    Rendering of the view might require lazy fetching of associations.
                </p></li></ul></div><p>
            The more transactions per request, the more likely we are to encounter atomicity
            and isolation problems when our application is processing many concurrent requests.
            Certainly, all write operations should occur in the same transaction!
    	</p><p>
            Hibernate users developed the <span class="emphasis"><em>"open session in view"</em></span> pattern to work 
            around this problem. In the Hibernate community, "open session in view" was historically 
            even more important because frameworks like Spring use transaction-scoped persistence contexts. 
            So rendering the view would cause <tt class="literal">LazyInitializationException</tt>s when 
            unfetched associations were accessed.
    	</p><p>
            This pattern is usually implemented as a single transaction which spans the entire request. 
            There are several problems with this implementation, the most serious being that we 
            can never be sure that a transaction is successful until we commit it&#8212;but by the 
            time the "open session in view" transaction is committed, the view is fully rendered, and 
            the rendered response may already have been flushed to the client. How can we notify the 
            user that their transaction was unsuccessful? 
    	</p><p>
            Seam solves both the transaction isolation problem and the association fetching problem, 
            while working around the problems with "open session in view". The solution comes in two 
            parts:
    	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                    use an extended persistence context that is scoped to the conversation, 
                    instead of to the transaction
    			</p></li><li><p>
                    use two transactions per request; the first spans the beginning of the update model
                    values phase until the end of the invoke application phase; the second spans the
                    render response phase
    			</p></li></ul></div><p>
            In the next section, we'll tell you how to set up a conversation-scope persistence
            context. But first we need to tell you how to enable Seam transaction management.
            Note that you can use conversation-scoped persistence contexts without Seam
            transaction management, and there are good reasons to use Seam transaction management
            even when you're not using Seam-managed persistence contexts. However, the two
            facilities were designed to work together, and work best when used together.
    	</p><p>
            Seam transaction management is useful even if you're using EJB 3.0 
            container-managed persistence contexts. But it is especially useful
            if you use Seam outside a Java EE 5 environment, or in any other
            case where you would use a Seam-managed persistence context.

            If you're using Seam outside of a Java EE 5 environment, you can't rely upon the
            container to manage the persistence context lifecycle for you. Even if you are
            in an EE 5 environment, you might have a complex application with many loosly
            coupled components that collaborate together in the scope of a single conversation,
            and in this case you might find that propagation of the persistence context between
            component is tricky and error-prone.
        </p><p>
            In either case, you'll need to use a <span class="emphasis"><em>managed persistence context</em></span> 
            (for JPA) or a <span class="emphasis"><em>managed session</em></span> (for Hibernate) in your components.
            A Seam-managed persistence context is just a built-in Seam component that manages an
            instance of <tt class="literal">EntityManager</tt> or <tt class="literal">Session</tt> in the
            conversation context. You can inject it with <tt class="literal">@In</tt>.
        </p><p>
            Seam-managed persistence contexts are extremely efficient in a clustered environment.
            Seam is able to perform an optimization that EJB 3.0 specification does not allow 
            containers to use for container-managed extended persistence contexts. Seam supports
            transparent failover of extended persisence contexts, without the need to replicate
            any persistence context state between nodes. (We hope to fix this oversight in the
            next revision of the EJB spec.)
        </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e5797"></a>8.3.1.&nbsp;Using a Seam-managed persistence context with JPA</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            Configuring a managed persistence context is easy. In <tt class="literal">components.xml</tt>, 
            we can write:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;persistence:managed-persistence-context name="bookingDatabase" 
                                  auto-create="true"
                   persistence-unit-jndi-name="java:/EntityManagerFactories/bookingData"/&gt;</pre><p>
            This configuration creates a conversation-scoped Seam component named 
            <tt class="literal">bookingDatabase</tt> that manages the lifecycle of <tt class="literal">EntityManager</tt> 
            instances for the persistence unit (<tt class="literal">EntityManagerFactory</tt> instance) 
            with JNDI name <tt class="literal">java:/EntityManagerFactories/bookingData</tt>.
        </p><p>
            Of course, you need to make sure that you have bound the <tt class="literal">EntityManagerFactory</tt> 
            into JNDI. In JBoss, you can do this by adding the following property setting to 
            <tt class="literal">persistence.xml</tt>.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;property name="jboss.entity.manager.factory.jndi.name" 
          value="java:/EntityManagerFactories/bookingData"/&gt;</pre><p>
            Now we can have our <tt class="literal">EntityManager</tt> injected using:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">@In EntityManager bookingDatabase;</pre><p>
            If you are using EJB3 and mark your class or method 
            <tt class="literal">@TransactionAttribute(REQUIRES_NEW)</tt> then the 
            transaction and persistence context shouldn't be propagated to method
            calls on this object.  However as the Seam-managed persistence
            context is propagated to any component within the conversation, it
            will be propagated to methods marked <tt class="literal">REQUIRES_NEW</tt>.
            Therefore, if you mark a method <tt class="literal">REQUIRES_NEW</tt> then
            you should access the entity manager using @PersistenceContext.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e5849"></a>8.3.2.&nbsp;Using a Seam-managed Hibernate session</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            Seam-managed Hibernate sessions are similar. In <tt class="literal">components.xml</tt>:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;persistence:hibernate-session-factory name="hibernateSessionFactory"/&gt;

&lt;persistence:managed-hibernate-session name="bookingDatabase" 
                                auto-create="true"
                  session-factory-jndi-name="java:/bookingSessionFactory"/&gt;</pre><p>
            Where <tt class="literal">java:/bookingSessionFactory</tt> is the name of the session factory 
            specified in <tt class="literal">hibernate.cfg.xml</tt>. 
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;session-factory name="java:/bookingSessionFactory"&gt;
    &lt;property name="transaction.flush_before_completion"&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="connection.release_mode"&gt;after_statement&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="transaction.manager_lookup_class"&gt;org.hibernate.transaction.JBossTransactionManagerLookup&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="transaction.factory_class"&gt;org.hibernate.transaction.JTATransactionFactory&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="connection.datasource"&gt;java:/bookingDatasource&lt;/property&gt;
    ...
&lt;/session-factory&gt;</pre><p>
            Note that Seam does not flush the session, so you should always enable
            <tt class="literal">hibernate.transaction.flush_before_completion</tt> to 
            ensure that the session is automatically flushed before the JTA transaction
            commits.
        </p><p>
            We can now have a managed Hibernate <tt class="literal">Session</tt> injected into our
            JavaBean components using the following code:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">@In Session bookingDatabase;</pre></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e5881"></a>8.3.3.&nbsp;Seam-managed persistence contexts and atomic conversations</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            Persistence contexts scoped to the conversation allows you to program optimistic 
            transactions that span multiple requests to the server without the need to use the 
            <tt class="literal">merge()</tt> operation , without the need to re-load 
            data at the beginning of each request, and without the need to wrestle with the 
            <tt class="literal">LazyInitializationException</tt> or 
            <tt class="literal">NonUniqueObjectException</tt>.
        </p><p>
            As with any optimistic transaction management, transaction isolation and consistency
            can be achieved via use of optimistic locking. Fortunately, both Hibernate and EJB 
            3.0 make it very easy to use optimistic locking, by providing the 
            <tt class="literal">@Version</tt> annotation.
        </p><p>
            By default, the persistence context is flushed (synchronized with the database)
            at the end of each transaction. This is sometimes the desired behavior. But very 
            often, we would prefer that all changes are held in memory and only written to
            the database when the conversation ends successfully. This allows for truly
            atomic conversations. As the result of a truly stupid and shortsighted decision
            by certain non-JBoss, non-Sun and non-Sybase members of the EJB 3.0 expert group, 
            there is currently no simple, usable and portable way to implement atomic 
            conversations using EJB 3.0 persistence. However, Hibernate provides this feature
            as a vendor extension to the <tt class="literal">FlushModeType</tt>s defined by the 
            specification, and it is our expectation that other vendors will soon provide
            a similar extension.
        </p><p>
            Seam lets you specify <tt class="literal">FlushModeType.MANUAL</tt> when beginning a
            conversation. Currently, this works only when Hibernate is the underlying 
            persistence provider, but we plan to support other equivalent vendor extensions.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">@In EntityManager em; //a Seam-managed persistence context

@Begin(flushMode=MANUAL)
public void beginClaimWizard() {
    claim = em.find(Claim.class, claimId);
}</pre><p>
            Now, the <tt class="literal">claim</tt> object remains managed by the persistence context
            for the rest ot the conversation. We can make changes to the claim:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">public void addPartyToClaim() {
    Party party = ....;
    claim.addParty(party);
}</pre><p>
            But these changes will not be flushed to the database until we explicitly force
            the flush to occur:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">@End
public void commitClaim() {
    em.flush();
}</pre><p>
            Of course, you could set the <tt class="literal">flushMode</tt> to <tt class="literal">MANUAL</tt>
            from pages.xml, for example in a navigation rule:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;begin-conversation flush-mode="MANUAL" /&gt;</pre></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e5933"></a>8.4.&nbsp;Using the JPA "delegate"</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            The <tt class="literal">EntityManager</tt> interface lets you access a vendor-specific
            API via the <tt class="literal">getDelegate()</tt> method. Naturally, the most interesting
            vendor is Hibernate, and the most powerful delegate interface is
            <tt class="literal">org.hibernate.Session</tt>. You'd be nuts to use anything else. Trust
            me, I'm not biased at all.

            But regardless of whether you're using Hibernate (genius!) or something else
            (masochist, or just not very bright), you'll almost certainly want to use the
            delegate in your Seam components from time to time. One approach would be the
            following:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">@In EntityManager entityManager;

@Create
public void init() {
    ( (Session) entityManager.getDelegate() ).enableFilter("currentVersions");
}</pre><p>
             But typecasts are unquestionably the ugliest syntax in the Java language, so most
             people avoid them whenever possible. Here's a different way to get at the 
             delegate. First, add the following line to <tt class="literal">components.xml</tt>:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;factory name="session" 
         scope="STATELESS" 
         auto-create="true" 
         value="#{entityManager.delegate}"/&gt;</pre><p>
            Now we can inject the session directly:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">@In Session session;

@Create
public void init() {
    session.enableFilter("currentVersions");
}</pre></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e5962"></a>8.5.&nbsp;Using EL in EJB-QL/HQL</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            Seam proxies the <tt class="literal">EntityManager</tt> or <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
            object whenever you use a Seam-managed persistence context or inject a container
            managed persistence context using <tt class="literal">@PersistenceContext</tt>. This
            lets you use EL expressions in your query strings, safely and efficiently. For
            example, this:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">User user = em.createQuery("from User where username=#{user.username}")
         .getSingleResult();</pre><p>is equivalent to:</p><pre class="programlisting">User user = em.createQuery("from User where username=:username")
         .setParameter("username", user.getUsername())
         .getSingleResult();</pre><p>
            Of course, you should never, ever write it like this:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">User user = em.createQuery("from User where username=" + user.getUsername()) //BAD!
         .getSingleResult();</pre><p>
            (It is inefficient and vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.)

            The coolest, and most unique, feature of Hibernate is <span class="emphasis"><em>filters</em></span>.
            Filters let you provide a restricted view of the data in the database. You can find 
            out more about filters in the Hibernate documentation. But we thought we'd mention
            an easy way to incorporate filters into a Seam application, one that works especially
            well with the Seam Application Framework.
        </p><p>
            Seam-managed persistence contexts may have a list of filters defined, which will be
            enabled whenever an <tt class="literal">EntityManager</tt> or Hibernate <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
            is first created. (Of course, they may only be used when Hibernate is the underlying
            persistence provider.)
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;persistence:filter name="regionFilter"&gt;
    &lt;persistence:name&gt;region&lt;/persistence:name&gt;
    &lt;persistence:parameters&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;regionCode&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;#{region.code}&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/persistence:parameters&gt;
&lt;/persistence:filter&gt;

&lt;persistence:filter name="currentFilter"&gt;
    &lt;persistence:name&gt;current&lt;/persistence:name&gt;
    &lt;persistence:parameters&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;date&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;#{currentDate}&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/persistence:parameters&gt;
&lt;/persistence:filter&gt;

&lt;persistence:managed-persistence-context name="personDatabase"
    persistence-unit-jndi-name="java:/EntityManagerFactories/personDatabase"&gt;
    &lt;core:filters&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;#{regionFilter}&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;#{currentFilter}&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/core:filters&gt;
